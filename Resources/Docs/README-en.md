# Slow Quit Apps - Installation Guide

## First-Time Setup

### 1. Grant Accessibility Permission

This app requires **Accessibility permission** to monitor keyboard shortcuts.

**How to enable:**
1. Open the app, it will prompt for permission
2. Click **"Open System Settings"** or go to: 
   - **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
3. Find **"SlowQuitApps"** in the list
4. Toggle the switch to **ON**
5. Click **"Restart App"** button in the app settings

> ⚠️ If you don't see the app in the list, click the **+** button and add it manually from the Applications folder.

### 2. Allow Application List Access (Optional)

When you first open the **App List** tab, macOS may ask for permission to access installed applications. This allows you to:
- Add apps to the whitelist (apps that can quit without long-press)
- Manage which apps are protected

---

## How It Works

- Press and **hold** ⌘Q for the configured duration to quit apps
- Release early to cancel the quit
- Apps in the whitelist can quit immediately without holding

## Quick Tips

- 💡 Adjust hold duration in **General** settings (0.3s - 3.0s)
- 💡 Add frequently-quit apps to the whitelist
- 💡 The app runs in the menu bar
